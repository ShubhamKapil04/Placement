Approach 1 for Count Number of Occurrences in a Sorted Array

1. Simply do a modified binary search such that
2. Find the first occurrence of X like this:

 a. Check if the middle element of the array is equal to X.
    1. If the equal or greater element is at mid then reduce the partition from start to mid-1. 
       As we will have the first occurrence on the left side of mid of array then.
   
    2. If the middle element is smaller then we will check in the right side of the middle element as the array is sorted.
       Return the first occurrence.


3. Now similarly find the last occurrence of X in the array by doing

   Check if the middle element of the array is equal to X
   If the equal or smaller element is at mid then increase the partition from mid+1 to high. As we will have the last occurrence on the right side of mid of array then.
   Else search in the left side of array
   return the last occurrence

4. Now the number of occurrences is simply the last occurrence â€“ first occurrence+1
